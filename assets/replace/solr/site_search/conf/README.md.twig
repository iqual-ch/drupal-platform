# Solr Configuration Directory

In order for the `solr` integration to work properly, you need to add the solr core configuration to this folder. This setup only supports a single `site_search` Solr core.

Make sure to follow the documentation to add the `site_search` Solr configuration. After adding the configuration you have to execute `composer project:scaffold` and reboot your environment.

> This file is removed if a `sorconfig.xml` exists in this directory when `composer project:scaffold` is run.
